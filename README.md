# Software testing
This is the repository to practice the exercises in the class and follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification).

# Template for commints
**This is what a commit should look like this:**

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>
    [optional body]
    [optional footer(s)]

**The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:**

- **fix:** a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).

- **feat:** a commit of the type `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).

- **BREAKING CHANGE:** a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

- **Types other than fix: and feat:** are allowed, for example [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links) (based on the [Angular convention](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines)) recommends `build:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.

**Footers other than `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`** may be provided and follow a convention similar to [git trailer format]`(https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commitâ€™s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

    fix: prevent racing of requests

    Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss incoming responses other than from latest request.

    Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are obsolete now.
